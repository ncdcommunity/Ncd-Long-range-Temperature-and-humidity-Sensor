# ZigBee Coordinator Long Range Wireless Mesh Modem with USB Interface
- **ZigBee Wireless Communication**
Mesh Networking is simply the hottest wireless technology of our time. Period. It’s fast, it’s very easy to use, highly reliable, and self healing. Three components are required for the ZigBee Mesh Network, the Coordinator (C), the Router (R) and the Endpoint (E). Your computer can speak to a ZigBee Mesh Network using a Coordinator. Think of the Coordinator as the interface to a ZigBee Mesh Network. NCD Coordinators are equipped with a USB Interface. This ZigBee Coordinator mounts as a Serial Port on your computer, and you will develop software that sends Serial commands at 115.2K Baud. The primary job of a router is to bridge the wireless gap between your computer (the Coordinator) and the device (Endpoint). If the Coordinator cannot speak to the Endpoint device because it is out of range, a Router can be used to bridge the two devices together. Endpoints are simply devices. With regard to NCD products, Endpoints can be relay controllers, data collection devices, PWM devices, and much more.

- **USB ZigBee Coordinator**
Your computer can speaks to a ZB ZigBee Network using a Coordinator.  Think of the Coordinator as the interface to a ZB ZigBee Network.  NCD ZigBee Coordinators are equipped with a USB Interface.  USB Coordinators mount as a Serial Port on your computer, and you will develop software that sends Serial commands at 115.2K Baud.  Only ONE Coordinator should be installed within a wireless ZB ZigBee Network.  Two types of Coordinators are available.  AT and API.  Normally, AT coordinators are used.  AT coordinators use Terminal-like AT commands to speak to a ZB ZigBee Network.  They are easier to use than an API coordinator.  An API coordinator uses a string of carefully chosen bytes and checksums to communicate data to a ZigBee networking.  API coordinators are harder to use, but can communicate and switch between devices much faster.  This page will introduce you to AT coordinators.  You can choose between AT and API firmware at checkout.

Software Used:
- Arduino IDE
- [Ubidot](https://ubidots.com/)

Library Used:
- PubSubClient Library
- Wire.h

# Arduino Client for MQTT
This library provides a client for doing simple publish/subscribe messaging with a server that supports MQTT

For more information about MQTT, visit [mqtt.org](http://mqtt.org/).
## Download
The latest version of the library can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient/releases/tag/v2.7)
## Documentation
The library comes with a number of example sketches. See File > Examples > PubSubClient within the Arduino application.
Full [API Documentation](https://pubsubclient.knolleary.net/api.html).
## Compatible Hardware
The library uses the Arduino Ethernet Client api for interacting with the underlying network hardware. This means it Just Works with a growing number of boards and shields, including:

- Arduino Ethernet
- Arduino Ethernet Shield
- Arduino YUN – use the included YunClient in place of EthernetClient, and be sure to do a Bridge.begin() first
- Arduino WiFi Shield - if you want to send packets greater than 90 bytes with this shield, enable the [MQTT_MAX_TRANSFER_SIZE]  (https://pubsubclient.knolleary.net/api.html#configoptions) option in   PubSubClient.h.
- Sparkfun WiFly Shield – when used with [this](https://github.com/dpslwk/WiFly) library
- Intel Galileo/Edison
- ESP8266
- ESP32
The library cannot currently be used with hardware based on the ENC28J60 chip – such as the Nanode or the Nuelectronics Ethernet Shield. For those, there is an alternative library available.

# Wire Library
  The Wire library allows you to communicate with I2C devices, often also called "2 wire" or "TWI" (Two Wire Interface),can download  from [Wire.h](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/Wire)
## Basic Usage
- Wire.begin()
  Begin using Wire in master mode, where you will initiate and control data transfers. This is the most common use when interfacing with   most I2C peripheral chips.

- Wire.begin(address)
  Begin using Wire in slave mode, where you will respond at "address" when other I2C masters chips initiate communication.
  
 ## Transmitting
 - Wire.beginTransmission(address)
   Start a new transmission to a device at "address". Master mode is used.

- Wire.write(data)
  Send data. In master mode, beginTransmission must be called first.

- Wire.endTransmission()
  In master mode, this ends the transmission and causes all buffered data to be sent.
  
## Receiving
- Wire.requestFrom(address, count)
  Read "count" bytes from a device at "address". Master mode is used.

- Wire.available()
  Retuns the number of bytes available by calling receive.

- Wire.read()
  Receive 1 byte.
